Building:
=========

Go to <src>/build
On Windows:  cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
On Mac OS X: cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
On Linux:    cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/cuda/include/ -DOpenCL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libOpenCL.so

Note:
If running on Win10 on a Samba share, there seems to be an issue with cmake:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/18086

As a workaround, run the following command before cmake .. -G ...:
mkdir -p CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp/CMakeFiles && (cd CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp/CMakeFiles && start cmd //c "pause")


cmake --build . --config Release
